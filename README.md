# Landing-Page
First attempt at creating an entire web page from a design provided by the Odin Project. 

The goal of this project is to create a webiste using all the learning material provided in the Foundations section of the Odin Project. I hope to primarily make this website using CSS Flexbox as that was the primary focus of the previous lession. 

This webpage will consist of a header which includes a logo along with 3 links, three content boxes that will include their own information/graphics/text and a call to action box, and finally a footer. While I do not actually use graphics in this section, such as suggested images, placeholders have been set and a description has been added for those placeholders.
