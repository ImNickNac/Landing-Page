# Landing-Page
First attempt at creating an entire web page from a design provided by the Odin Project. 

The goal of this project is to create a webiste using all the learning material provided in the Foundations section of the Odin Project. I hope to primarily make this website using CSS Flexbox as that was the primary focus of the previous lession. 


This webpage will consist of a header which includes a logo along with 3 links, three content boxes that will include their own information/graphics/text and a call to action box, and finally a footer. 

The following statement was the original plan: 

    While I do not actually use graphics in this section, such as suggested images, placeholders have been set and a description has been added for those placeholders. 

However, I have decided to include actual images in the project due to needing more experience working with them. The following information is giving credit to the creators of the images: 
    "Image-1" - Road in City during Sunset by Nout Gons - link "pexels.com/photo/road-in-city-during-sunset-248159/"
    
    "Image-2" - Red and Blue Hot Air Balloon floating on Air on Body of Water during Night Time by Bess Hamiti - link "pexels.com/photo/red-and-blue-hot-air-balloon-floating-on-air-on-body-of-water-during-night-time-36487/"
