# Landing-Page
First attempt at creating an entire web page modeling after an image provided by The Odin Project. 

The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch using the learning material provided in the Foundation section of the Odin Project. I will primarily use the CSS Flexbox style
due to that being the main focus of the previous lessons.

The webpage consists of a header that has a home page logo link and 3 additional links, and three content boxes followed by a footer. The content boxes have their own information/graphics/text and a call to action box with two sign up buttons. 

The original plan was to just mimic the image directly, meaning I would provide blank spaces for the images that someone could add. However, after attempting to create the webpage, I realized I do not have much experience creating webpages with images and decided to go back and add the images in. All citiations to the images have been provided at the bottom of this document. 

Post completion thoughts:
    The project was a serious challenge for me; however I did enjoy the process and felt a great deal of satifastion upon completion. The largest hurdle I had to overcome was figuring out which section to add in the required information to format the content correctly. For example, adding 'justify-content: center;' to the correct box I created. While I did complete the project as intended, I can't help but feel the CSS section of the project may have redundant information used. I was not able to combine any CSS properties to multiple elements at the same time, but I do hope to improve this area of weekness in the future. The following is the links to credit the images used, followed by an uneddited version of the README.md document that I made while following through this document. The original iteration of text is simply included to preserve my thoughts and plans going into this project and should be ignored by those reviewing this document.

The following is the orginal README.md Document as I was creating the project:


First attempt at creating an entire web page from a design provided by the Odin Project. 

The goal of this project is to create a webiste using all the learning material provided in the Foundations section of the Odin Project. I hope to primarily make this website using CSS Flexbox as that was the primary focus of the previous lession. 


This webpage will consist of a header which includes a logo along with 3 links, three content boxes that will include their own information/graphics/text and a call to action box, and finally a footer. 

The following statement was the original plan: 

    While I do not actually use graphics in this section, such as suggested images, placeholders have been set and a description has been added for those placeholders. 

However, I have decided to include actual images in the project due to needing more experience working with them. The following information is giving credit to the creators of the images: 
    "Image-1" - Road in City during Sunset by Nout Gons - link "pexels.com/photo/road-in-city-during-sunset-248159/"
    
    "Image-2" - Red and Blue Hot Air Balloon floating on Air on Body of Water during Night Time by Bess Hamiti - link "pexels.com/photo/red-and-blue-hot-air-balloon-floating-on-air-on-body-of-water-during-night-time-36487/"
